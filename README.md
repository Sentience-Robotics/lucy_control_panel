# Lucy Control Panel
<!-- Advanced web-based control interface for InMoov humanoid robots with real-time 3D visualization -->

A modern, TUI-themed web interface for controlling robots with real-time joint manipulation and immersive 3D visualization.

---

## 📌 Overview

Lucy Control Panel is a comprehensive web-based control system designed specifically for robots. Built with React and Three.js, it provides an intuitive terminal-style interface that allows users to control individual robot joints, save/load poses, and visualize the robot in real-time 3D.

The application features a distinctive green-on-black cyberpunk aesthetic reminiscent of classic terminal interfaces, making robot control both functional and visually engaging. Whether you're programming complex movements or fine-tuning individual joints, Lucy Control Panel provides the tools needed for precise robot manipulation.
