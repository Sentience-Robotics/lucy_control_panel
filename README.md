# Lucy Control Panel
<!-- Advanced web-based control interface for InMoov humanoid robots with real-time 3D visualization -->

A modern, TUI-themed web interface for controlling robots with real-time joint manipulation and immersive 3D visualization.

---

## 📌 Overview

Lucy Control Panel is a comprehensive web-based control system designed specifically for robots. Built with React and Three.js, it provides an intuitive terminal-style interface that allows users to control individual robot joints, save/load poses, and visualize the robot in real-time 3D.

The application features a distinctive green-on-black cyberpunk aesthetic reminiscent of classic terminal interfaces, making robot control both functional and visually engaging. Whether you're programming complex movements or fine-tuning individual joints, Lucy Control Panel provides the tools needed for precise robot manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

- **🎮 Real-time Joint Control** - Individual control of all robot joints with precision sliders and input fields. Sliders display the **hardware-defined** servo range (`servo_min_deg` / `servo_max_deg` from the active YAML) so you can probe the full mechanical envelope; URDF `<limit>` enforcement is performed downstream by `ros2_control` (`LucySystemHardware`).
- **👥 Multi-client exclusive control** - Multiple browsers can connect simultaneously; only one publishes at a time — see [Connection & Control user flow](docs/guides/connection-and-control.md)
- **📡 Live motor feedback** - 3D viewer and slider readback consume `/joint_states` (URDF radians) and convert to servo degrees with the per-joint mapping (`offset_deg`, `direction`, `scale`).
- **🎯 URDF Parser** - Automatic parsing of InMoov URDF files to extract joint configurations and constraints
- **💾 Pose Management** - Save, load, and manage multiple robot poses with custom names
- **⚙️ Activate / Configure workflow** - Five-step pipeline (VALIDATE → GENERATE → BUILD → FLASH → RELOAD) with a dedicated **GENERATE** step that regenerates `ros2_control` xacro + `controllers.yaml` even in *SIMULATION ONLY* mode (no firmware build).
- **🔄 Drag & Drop Categories** - Reorganize joint categories (Head, Arms, Torso, etc.) via intuitive drag-and-drop
- **📐 Unit Conversion** - Toggle between degrees and radians for joint angle display
- **🤖 3D Robot Visualization** - Real-time 3D rendering of robot meshes with STL support
- **⚙️ Visual Controls** - Wireframe mode, grid display, transparency adjustment, and camera controls
- **🎨 Cyberpunk UI** - Terminal-inspired interface with signature green glow effects
- **📱 Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **🔌 Connection Management** - Visual connection status and control interface
- **🔐 Secure Authentication** - Optional username and password protection with MD5 encryption
- **🌐 Custom ROS Bridge URL** - Configurable ROS Bridge connection with persistent settings

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

| Tool | Required version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | **≥ 22.0.0** | `camera-controls` requires Node 22+ |
| Yarn | 1.x (classic) | `npm install -g yarn` |

> **Quick Node upgrade with nvm**
>
> If you have Node < 22 (e.g. the Ubuntu 22.04 default 18.x), install nvm and switch:
> ```sh
> # Install nvm (skip if already installed)
> curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash
> source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc
>
> # Install and activate Node 22
> nvm install 22
> nvm use 22         # or: nvm use  (auto-reads .nvmrc)
>
> # Verify
> node --version     # should print v22.x.x
> ```
>
> A `.nvmrc` file at the project root pins the version — running `nvm use` from the directory is sufficient on future sessions.

## 📦 Installation

```sh
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sentience-robotics/lucy_control_panel.git
cd lucy_control_panel

# 2. Switch to the required Node version (requires nvm)
nvm use

# 3. Install dependencies
yarn install

# 4. Copy the example environment file and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env
```

See the [Configuration](#️-configuration) section below for all available environment variables.

---

## ▶️ Run

### Development

Starts the Vite dev server with hot-module replacement.

```sh
yarn run dev
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:3000` by default (or the port set in `VITE_PORT`).

### Production build

```sh
# Full build (TypeScript type-check + Vite bundle)
yarn build

# Quick build (Vite only, skips tsc)
yarn quickbuild

# Preview the production bundle locally
yarn preview
```

### HTTPS (self-signed certificates)

Required when the robot's ROS Bridge runs over HTTPS / WSS:

```sh
cd certs && ./generate_certificate.sh && cd ..
```

Then set in `.env`:

```env
VITE_HTTPS=true
VITE_SSL_CERT_PATH=./certs/cert.pem
VITE_SSL_KEY_PATH=./certs/key.pem
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to configure the application:

```env
# Authentication (both required for password protection)
VITE_LOCAL_USERNAME=admin
VITE_LOCAL_PASSWORD=5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

VITE_PORT=3000
VITE_OVERRIDE_ROS_BRIDGE_SERVER_URL=https://100.100.100.100:5000/rosbridge

VITE_ENABLE_LOGS=true

# Hardware YAML editor (`/robot-configuration`): header shows `robot_name` from loaded YAML (via ROS config/get).
```

### Authentication Setup

1. **Username**: Set `VITE_LOCAL_USERNAME` to your desired username
2. **Password**: Set `VITE_LOCAL_PASSWORD` to the MD5 hash of your password
   - Generate MD5 hash: `echo -n "yourpassword" | md5sum`
   - Example: Password "lucy123" → MD5 hash "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592"

**Note**: If either `VITE_LOCAL_USERNAME` or `VITE_LOCAL_PASSWORD` is not set, the application will run without authentication.
